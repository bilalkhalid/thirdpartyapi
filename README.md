Third Party Data Sources pulled into Discovery API

Use the [Jena SPARQL Tutorial](http://jena.apache.org/tutorials/sparql.html) to get started with SPARQL. More information on how to get up to speed with SPARQL from this [Code4lib List discussion](https://listserv.nd.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A1=ind1405&L=CODE4LIB#11)

Use the examples in the repository as examples of how to interrogate your data source. When completed review the examples in the repositories YAML file (all of which are getting information about a specific date)

Check YAML with YAML Lint to verify code
